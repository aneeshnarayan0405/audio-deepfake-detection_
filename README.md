Audio Deepfake Detection Assessment

Part 1: Research & Selection

I reviewed the GitHub repository on audio deepfake detection:  
[Audio-Deepfake-Detection](https://github.com/media-sec-lab/Audio-Deepfake-Detection) 
Based on my analysis, I selected the following three approaches:

1. Wav2Vec 2.0-Based Detection
a. Key Technical Innovation:
  - Self-supervised learning-based feature extraction.
  - Fine-tuned for deepfake detection.
b. Reported Performance Metrics:
  - Accuracy: 95%+ on ASVspoof datasets.
  - Robust against noise and distortions.
Why This Approach?
  - Effective for detecting subtle differences in AI-generated speech.
  - Works well with real-time applications.
Challenges:
  - Requires large-scale pretraining.
  - Computationally expensive.

2. CNN-Based Deepfake Detection

Key Technical Innovation:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for frequency-domain feature extraction.
  - Uses spectrograms (MFCCs or Mel spectrograms) as input.
Reported Performance Metrics:
  - Accuracy: 90-93% on ASVspoof datasets.
  - Computationally efficient.
Why This Approach?*
  - Strong generalization on unseen deepfake attacks.
  - Suitable for real-time and low-latency scenarios.
Challenges:
  - Sensitive to noise.
  - Needs augmentation for better robustness.

3. LSTM-Based Sequential Modeling
Key Technical Innovation:
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for temporal feature extraction.
  - Captures sequential dependencies in audio data.
Reported Performance Metrics:
  - Accuracy: 88-92% on ASVspoof datasets.
  - Handles varying speech patterns.
Why This Approach?
  - Detects fine-grained variations in AI-generated speech.
  - Effective in analyzing real conversations.
Challenges:
  - Training complexity is high.
  - Prone to overfitting on small datasets.
