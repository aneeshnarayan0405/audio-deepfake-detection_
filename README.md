  - Robust against noise and distortions.
- **Why This Approach?**
  - Effective for detecting subtle differences in AI-generated speech.
  - Works well with real-time applications.
- **Challenges**:
  - Requires large-scale pretraining.
  - Computationally expensive.

### **2. CNN-Based Deepfake Detection**
- **Key Technical Innovation**:

  - Captures sequential dependencies in audio data.
- **Reported Performance Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: 88-92% on ASVspoof datasets.
  - Handles varying speech patterns.
- **Why This Approach?**
  - Detects fine-grained variations in AI-generated speech.
  - Effective in analyzing real conversations.
- **Challenges**:
  - Training complexity is high.
  - Prone to overfitting on small datasets.
 



## Part 2: Implementation

### **Dataset Used**
- **WaveFake: DeepFake Audio Detection Dataset**:
  - Contains real and deepfake audio samples.
  - Used for fine-tuning our model.

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extract Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) from audio files.
   - Normalize and reshape features for CNN input.

2. **CNN Model Architecture**:
   - **Conv1D layers** for feature extraction.
   - **MaxPooling layers** for dimensionality reduction.
   - **Dense and Dropout layers** for classification.

3. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - Used **80% training / 20% testing** split.
   - Optimized using **Adam optimizer**.
   - Evaluated using **accuracy and F1-score**.

4. **Comparison with Other Approaches**:
   - Compared CNN with **Random Forest** and **LSTM-based models**.
   - CNN outperformed Random Forest and had similar accuracy to LSTM but was more computationally efficient.
  

## Dataset Used  
- **Name:** FakeAudio  
- **Source:** [FakeAudio Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/walimuhammadahmad/fakeaudio)  
- **Description:** Contains real and AI-generated audio samples for deepfake detection.
